##############The Adapter pattern should be used when###########

#### There is an existing class, and its interface does not match the one you need.
#### You want to create a reusable class that cooperates with unrelated or unforeseen classes,
 	 that is, classes that don’t necessarily have compatible interfaces.
#### There are several existing subclasses to be use, but it’s impractical to adapt their interface by subclassing every one. An object
	 adapter can adapt the interface of its parent class
