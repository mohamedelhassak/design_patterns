##############The Adapter pattern should be used when###########

#### 1 - There is an existing class, and its interface does not match the one you need.
#### 2 - You want to create a reusable class that cooperates with unrelated or unforeseen classes,
 	 that is, classes that do not necessarily have compatible interfaces.
#### 3 - There are several existing subclasses to be use, but it is impractical to adapt their interface by subclassing every one. An object
	 adapter can adapt the interface of its parent class
